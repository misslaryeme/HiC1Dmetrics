# HiC1Dmetrics
This repository contain code and basic tutorial for "HiC1Dmetrics"

Basically, HiC1Dmetrics mainly provide two types of function:

- Multiple 1-D metrics for one Hi-C samples (Already published idea).
    - Directional Index (DI)
    - Insulation Score (IS)
    - Contrast Index (CI)
    - TAD separation score (TADsep)
    - More in building..
