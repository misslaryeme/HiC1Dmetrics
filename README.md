# Introduction

Basically, HiC1Dmetrics mainly provide three types of function:

1. Calculate and visulize multiple 1-D metrics for one Hi-C samples (Already published idea).
    - Directional Index (DI)
    - Insulation Score (IS)
    - Contrast Index (CI)
    - TAD separation score (TADsep)
    - Distal-to-Local Ratio (DLR)
    - More in building..

2. Calculate and visulize 1-D metrics for comparing two Hi-C samples 
    - **Directional Frequency Ratio**, DFR (Original metric)
    - Differential DLR
    - More in building ..

3. Extract and visulzie all "directional TAD" sites, which are defined by DFR metrics.
